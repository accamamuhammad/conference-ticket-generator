# Conference Ticket Generator App

Welcome to the **Conference Ticket Generator App**! This project is part of a **Frontend Mentor Challenge**, aimed at enhancing front-end development skills while tackling a practical use case.

## 🚀 Project Goal

The app allows users to generate personalized conference tickets by providing:

- An avatar or image
- A username
- An email address
- A GitHub username

With these details, the app creates a visually appealing ticket for the user.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project leverages the following technologies:

- **React**: For building a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **React Router**: For seamless navigation between pages.
- **Firebase**: For authentication and backend services.
  - **Firebase Realtime Database**: To store user-provided data in real-time.
- **JavaScript DOM Manipulation**: For dynamic updates and data rendering.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **User Input**: Enter avatar, username, email, and GitHub username.
- **Dynamic Ticket Generation**: Generate a ticket in real-time based on the input data.
- **Database Integration**: Save user data to Firebase for persistence.

## 📖 How It Works

1. User fills out the form with the required information.
2. The app processes the data and generates a custom conference ticket.
3. The ticket can be viewed and potentially downloaded (future enhancement).
